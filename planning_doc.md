Add Two Search Algorithms
    Which algorithms?
        DFS and Dijkstra's/UCS

Offer the user choice between automated maze solving and manual entry
    If the automated option is chosen have the user choose between astar, DFS, and Dijkstras
    If the manual option is chose have the user choose between unassisted and assisted

Add automation close
    Add options for limited algorithm knowledge, i.e. vision cone

Update config file to have larger area.

Add random obstacle class
    Ensure pathfind can handle random obstacles
